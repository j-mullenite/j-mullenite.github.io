        <p>i am a human geographer with interests in land use, infrastructure, and urban planning. my work focuses on the ways that historical decisions in these domains 
        (including in the creation of land use and infrastructure laws) create and perpetuate the conditions for urban environmental injustice. i examine the ways that
        people live within and outside of the formal structures of the State to better understand the underlying processes that shape individual and community-level 
        decision-making.</p>
        <p>i put my research to practice as a <a href="https://justcommunities.info" target="_blank">Just Communities AP</a> and as an appointed member of the Borough of Millvale
        Bike and Pedestrian committee. in these roles i bring together research and advocacy to make not only my own community but those nearby more just and sustainable.</p>
        <p>in my personal life i have played bass for more than 20 years and currently play with the band mayreh. i also take pictures, focusing on documenting everyday urbanity.</p>
